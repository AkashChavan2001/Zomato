# Zomato
A static Zomato-like webpage built using HTML and CSS provides a simple, visually appealing layout that showcases the concept of a food delivery service. The webpage can display restaurant listings, menu items, and basic user interface elements, but without dynamic functionalities like order placement or real-time updates, as it's a static page.
